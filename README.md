# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Shoot!

##### In this program, you will become the rock, paper, scissors champion. Compete against the computer to hone your skill.

# Purpose

##### The purpose of the exercise for the user is to have fun! The purpose for the developer was to practice writing Python code. While the game only plays through once, a future goal would be to add a loop to give the user the opportunity to play continuous games.

# Installation

##### In order to play the game, you will need to clone the repository to your local computer.

1. Navigate to the code dropdown menu on the repository in GitHub
2. Select "Open with GitHub Desktop"
3. Clone to an easy to find location like your local desktop

##### From the command-line, navigate to the local repository by using code like the following:

```
cd ~/Desktop/rock-paper-scissors-exercise
```

##### If you don't remember where you saved the repo locally, use the "Show in Finder" option when you open the file in GitHub Desktop.

# Setting Up Your Environment

##### Create and activate an Anaconda environment for the program using the following code:

```
conda create -n my-game-env python=3.8 # (first time only)
conda activate my-game-env
```

##### If you are uncertain if Anaconda is installed, use the following in your command-line:

```
conda --version
```

##### If it is not found, **[install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)** before proceeding with setting up your environment.

##### You will then be able to run the Rock, Paper, Scissors program by following the simple set of instructions to follow.
